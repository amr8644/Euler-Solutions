#  Problem #4

#  A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made 
#  from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.
#  Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.


let largest_number = 0

            if product == parse(Int, reversed)
